    input: shuf.a.bed.gz, calculate_lines_to_pull.tsv
    output: shuffled.bed.gz, output.bed.gz

    reason: Missing output files: output.bed.gz; Code has changed since last execution

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule subsample in file /home/bec51310.iitr/workplace/project/rescale_to_reference/snakemake.smk, line 23:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
shuffled.bed.gz (missing locally, parent dir not present)
Removing output files of failed job subsample since they might be corrupted:
output.bed.gz
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
