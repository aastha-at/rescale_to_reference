Error in rule subsample:
    jobid: 0
    input: shuf.a.bed.gz
    output: shuffled.bed.gz, output.bed.gz
    shell:
        
        zcat shuf.a.bed.gz | shuf | gzip > shuffled.bed.gz
        zcat shuffled.bed.gz | python scripts/rescaled.py | gzip > output.bed.gz
        
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job subsample since they might be corrupted:
shuffled.bed.gz, output.bed.gz
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
