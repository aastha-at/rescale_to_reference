Error in rule subsample:

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job subsample since they might be corrupted:
shuffled.bed.gz, rescaled.bed.gz
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
